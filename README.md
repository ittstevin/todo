# React Todo Application

This is a simple React application to m

anage a to-do list. It allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks from the list. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

## Installation

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

`git@github.com:ittstevin/todo.git`
`cd todo`

Then, install the required dependencies using npm:

`npm install`

## Usage

Start the development server with the following command:

`npm start`

The app should automatically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

To build the app for production, use the following command:

`npm run build`

This will create an optimized build of the app in the build directory.

## Structure

The application consists of the following components:

- App: The top-level component that renders the entire application.
- TodoList: Renders a list of tasks and allows the user to interact with each task.
- TodoItem: Renders an individual task with the ability to mark as complete or delete.
- TodoForm: Renders a form to add a new task to the list.

The application state is managed using React hooks in the App component.
